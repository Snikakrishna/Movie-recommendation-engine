# Movie recommendation engine
 This project implements a content-based movie recommendation engine using Python. The system suggests movies to users based on the similarity of movies' features, such as genres, actors, and directors. It calculates movie similarity scores and ranks movies based on how closely they align with a user-selected movie.
